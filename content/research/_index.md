Our research develops a **data-centric foundation for machine learning**—treating datasets not as passive artifacts but as structured, dynamic objects that can be characterized, transformed, and optimized. We draw on tools from optimal transport, information theory, and geometric deep learning to formalize how data properties affect learning outcomes.
